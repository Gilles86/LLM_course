Protected as a geographical indication of the European Union, only fruit spirits mashed, distilled, matured and bottled in Hungary and similar apricot spirits from four provinces of Austria can be called \"palinka\". A similar product exists in the Czech Republic and Slovakia where it is known as palenka, and in Romania (Transylvania), Italy, and Greece under the name palinca. While palinka is traditionally made from a mash of ripe fruit, the law does not control the addition of non-concentrated fruit juice, and explicitly allows the use of fruit pulp. Dried fruits are excluded from the mash only, and may be used in the aging process. While palinka has PDO on its own, some regions of Hungary are especially suitable for the production of certain fruits, and palinka of excellent quality has been produced in those regions for centuries. These local variations are protected as separate geographical indications and have their own well-detailed regulations.'\n","\n","tokens = tokenizer.encode(texts, return_tensors='pt').to(device)\n","numtoks = len(tokens[0])\n","numtoks"],"metadata":{"id":"IxdZnQhvWAta"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# run the model to get the activations\n","with torch.no_grad():\n","  model(tokens)\n","\n","# remove the hook\n","handle.remove()"],"metadata":{"id":"sqVP0eFyumBy"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# grab the activations\n","X = activations[f'mlp_{layer2hook}'].squeeze()\n","print(f'Activations size: {X.shape}')\n","\n","# move to GPU\n","X = X.to(device)"],"metadata":{"id":"miVC8vVDjvW_"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"yCOpK8xUWC9B"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Create and train the autoencoder"],"metadata":{"id":"T_TPzU3_naiU"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["class SparseAE(nn.Module):\n","  def __init__(self, input_dim, latent_dim, k=None, sparsity_weight=1, decor_weight=.0005):\n","    super().__init__()\n","    self.encoder = nn.Linear(input_dim, latent_dim, bias=False)\n","    #
