# A deep understanding of AI large language model mechanisms
Hi friends! This will be the git repo for all the code files for my mega-course on LLMs.

Course topics include building, training, fine-tuning, and investigating LLMs using mechanistic interpretability methods. Lots of hands-on demos and exercises in PyTorch.

This repo is currently empty because I haven't finished the course yet :P

But you can see the list of lectures and topics here:
