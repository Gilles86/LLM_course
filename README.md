## About the Course

This repository contains **all the Python code** for the Udemy course:  
**Deep Understanding of Large Language Models (LLMs): Architecture, Training, and Mechanisms**.

> **Course URL:** (will be updated soon!)
> *(90+ hours of intensive video lectures — theory, math, and code)*

This course is a **comprehensive deep dive** into **AI large language models** — the kind of models that power ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and other cutting-edge systems.  
It combines **mathematical foundations**, **architectural details**, and **hands-on PyTorch coding** to give you the deepest possible understanding of how LLMs work.

## What You Will Learn

- **Transformer architecture** and self-attention mechanisms  
- **Tokenization, embeddings, and encoding layers**  
- **Training LLMs from scratch** and fine-tuning pre-trained models  
- **Inference and decoding strategies**  
- **Optimization, regularization, and scaling laws**  
- **Evaluation metrics** and understanding LLM limitations  
- **PyTorch implementation** of core components  
- **Code challenges** with full explanations and solutions

---

## What's in This Repository

- All **lecture code** organized by course section and video  
- **Code Challenge solutions** — complete, commented Python scripts  
- **Custom PyTorch implementations** of LLM building blocks  
- **Data preprocessing and visualization** utilities


## Get the Full Learning Experience
While the code here is 100% free, the Udemy course includes:
- 90+ hours of video content
- Step-by-step walkthroughs of every code example
- Mathematical derivations for all key concepts
- Tips for real-world AI and NLP projects

## Why This Course Stands Out
- Unlike many AI tutorials, this course goes far beyond just calling APIs:
- Understand LLM internals — not just how to use them
- Build your own Transformer components from scratch in PyTorch
- Learn the why, not just the how
- Develop skills for research, engineering, and advanced ML work
